# MeanCourse

To run the application, we need to start the frontend and the backend seperately.

1. Start the backend server =>

   > mean-course> npm run start:server
   > This will start the backend Node.js server which runs on port 3000.
   > e.g. http://localhost:3000

2. Start the frontend server (Angular) =>
   > mean-course> ng serve
   > This will start the Angular frontend which runs on port 4200.
   > e.g. http://localhost:4200
